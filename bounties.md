# Monstercat Bounty Hunters Program
The Monstercat Bounty program rewards developers for helping us improve monstercat.com.

## How It Works
Any [Bounty-labelled GitHub issues](https://github.com/monstercat/deon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty) for monstercat.com are eligible for the bounty program. The reward will be listed in the description of the issue.

Any dev may submit a pull request against the `master` branch of that project. The bounty issue should be referenced in the description of the pull request. 

The first pull request for a bounty issue that is accepted and merged will earn that pull request's author the bounty amount, to be paid via PayPal.

## Code Ownership
All code submitted that is merged will be owned by Monstercat.

## Dev Community
Join the [#dev channel on our Discord](https://discord.gg/9MVbaZM) to chat with other developers from the Monstercat family.

## Code Guide
JavaScript should follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml).

Your pull request should pass the `npm test` tests.

## FAQ
