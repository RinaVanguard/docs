## Instructions
1. Print out the desired stencil.
2. Hollow out your pumpkin.
3. Tape the stencil to the pumpkin and while using a poker, poke holes along the dotted outline.
4. Remove the stencil from the pumpkin once complete.
	* _One trick is to pat flour over the outline so the flour fills the holes and you can see the outline clearer._
	* If you need more assistance with using stencils - [refer to this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtKPd59lst4).
5. Start carefully cutting out the pieces *marked in grey*.
6. Finish your pumpkin and bring it to life by placing a light inside.
7. Take a photo and send it to @Monstercat with the hashtag #MonstercatHalloween
