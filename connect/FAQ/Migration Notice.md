## 1. Business Model Changes – A new way to manage your license

*Current Model*

* Gold Subscription at $9.99/month

* +$4.99/month for each additional channel whitelist on your license

*New Model*

* Gold Membership Subscription at $4.99/month
* YouTube Whitelist at $9.99/month OR $200 for 20 months coverage 
* Twitch Whitelist at $4.99/month OR $100 for 20 months coverage
* Upon subscribing for 20 months for a channel whitelist, all your uploaded videos within your subscribed time period are safe from content ID claims even if you unsubscribe.

You now have the freedom of choice for which products you would like to use. This makes the service very friendly and flexible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does this affect current subscribers?**

If you are a current Gold Subscriber your subscription will be reduced to the new price of $5/month.

If you are a current License Subscriber your subscription will be reduced to a Gold subscription price of $5/month and your current whitelisted channels will all be paid off in full.

**What about extra credits or non-monthly subscription?**

*If you used Stripe*

Your subscription will be reduced to the $5/month Gold Membership as described and you will automatically be given free number of months prorated to your credits or what you have already pre-paid.

*If you used PayPal*

If you have a month to month subscription your subscription will be reduced to the $5/month Gold Membership and you will be given a coupon for any remaining credits.

If you have an irregular subscription (non-monthly) your subscription will be canceled and you will receive a coupon code with free months you are owed. If you want you may also alternatively request a refund for any remaining months.

**Why the difference for PayPal subscribers?**

The PayPal API does not allow us to modify your payment period or give you free access for any number of months.

**What does this mean for extra credit?**

Due to the complexities and required maintenance we have decided to discontinue the extra credit referral system. If you have credit please contact connect@monstercat.com
**What is the coupon good for?**

The coupon is only redeemable for the Gold Membership subscription.

**What is the benefit of pre-paying 20 months for a channel whitelist?**

Upon subscribing for 20 months, all your uploaded videos within your subscribed time period are safe from content ID claims even if you unsubscribe. This benefits creators that have been looking to do one-off videos with a specific track. 

**What if I cancel my subscription before 20 months are completed?**

If you end your white list subscription on a channel that has not been subscribed for 20 months, just like the old model your channel will then be subject to content-ID claims. You can remove those claims by re-subscribing again. 

**Will a white list subscription grant me access to the catalog just like the License Subscription did?**

No, you will have to purchase a gold subscription for now on to be granted downloadable access to our catalog. 

**What happens to the current Connect platform?**

You can still continue to use the old Connect platform until we decide it is appropriate to discontinue it and all of our users have been migrated successfully. Once this point has been reached you must access through Monstercat.com.

Once you have been migrated to the new business model you will be required to manage your subscription from the new platform.

**When will migration occur?**

The migration will begin in the coming weeks and it will be done in batches to ensure a smooth transition for all users. We estimate final migration to complete by September 1, 2016.
